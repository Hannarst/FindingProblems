              Problems and their solutions can be added to the database using one of two methods:
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <u>

                  </li>
          <p>
              Fill out and submit <a href="{% url 'add_problem' %}">this form</a>.
              You may use markdown in the content and the solution fields.
              The execution time limit is the maximum length of time a solution can run to be considered a successful solution to this problem.
              This is done to exclude brute force solutions if necessary.
              The problems you add are private by default and can only be seen by logged in users (CS staff), but uncheck this box if you want students to be able to practice this question on their own time.
              You also have the option of marking the problem as public but the solution as private, and only later releasing the solution.
              Categorise this problem as you see fit.

              <p>
                  Problems and solutions can also be created by uploading PDF documents.
                  Each document may contain only <u><strong>one</strong></u> problem or solution.
                  This is enforced to allow the user time to check that the system has created a problem or solution correctly from the uploaded PDF.
              </p>
              <p>
                  When doing so, please ensure that these documents conform to the following specifications:

                  Users will have the opportunity to confirm the content of problem and solution forms before submitting.
