<h4><a href="#edit-vs-fork">Editing vs forking a problem</a></h4>
<p>
  Editing (<i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i>) a problem rewrites the problem, while forking (<i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i>) a problem allows you to create a new problem from the modification.
  The original stays the same. You can later see which problem a particular problem has been forked off in the Forked From field.
